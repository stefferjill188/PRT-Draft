	"description1": "Dressing with style daily can be tiresome with extra time putting on makeup or picking out outfits, but often lends the momentary confidence to overcome our struggles. Today's look is all about being comfortable and professional that comes from your own beautiful self esteem. I'm not a girl who likes to glam up and go to Oscar parties. I am the type of woman who'd much rather spend that time giving a presentation to a group of people with hopes of a greater outcome for all. I am the type of woman who would much rather spend time learning and contributing to innovative technology. However, I have noticed my confidence also dwindles when I put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. Yes, it is comfortable, but I do not feel the same strength as when I put on a pant suit. With this in mind, I aim to dress more professionally while keeping a minimal lifestyle.",

As the sun gets higher in late morning, we stop for Umami brunch down town Los Angeles in the art district where walls are covered with colorful murals. Next door to food, a geometric wall awaits the perfect shoot for a minimalist look. Before chowing down on our burgers, we take advantage of the opportunity then begin our journey to Las Vegas.",

Launching this blog at the beginning of this year is symbolic of what 2015 has taught me and to stay strong despite the crap life sometimes throws at you. With that said, I couldn't be more happier to come back to the glam world of blogging. Since this post is truly symbolic of new beginnings, I've changed a few of my resolutions into vows. Whenever a day gets bad, I promise myself and to my readers to follow these vows like a newly blissful married couple.",
